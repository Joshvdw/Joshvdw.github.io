                    <h3>Difference between HTML & CSS</h3><br>
                    <p>HTML is like the meat and bones of an animal, the core anatomic structure if you will.</p>
                    <p>CSS is what you can see on the outside, the feathers, fur or scales that decorate and give color to a beast. 
                        Both work together and rely on one another to function properly.</p>
                    <p>Think of HTML like an elephant - it's large, and makes up the skeletal backbone of a website's structure.</p>
                    <p>CSS would be a peacock, because of its focus on looks, such as its flamboyant feather display.</p>
                    <p>It's usually best practice to write HTML before CSS!</p>

                    <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3><br>
                    <p>The control flow is the order in which the computer executes programming statements in JavaScript (or any other scripting language). Loops repeat this cycle a set amount specified by the program(mer).</p>
                    <p>I’m going to explain these concepts using everyday life examples.</p>
                    <p>Imagine you are cooking something new / unfamiliar from a recipe-book. 
                        You would follow the instructions exactly as described and in the exact order they are presented to you as well. Jumping ahead, such as by adding icing on the cake before you’ve actually made the cake, wouldn’t work. This is control flow!</p>
                    <p>Now imagine you’ve created a fresh batch of home-made plum jam. 
                        You have distributed the jam evenly across 9 jars and have the corresponding lids and packaging material ready to go next to it. The repeating process of packaging the jam jars a set amount of times (9 times in this instance) is similar to a JavaScript Loop. 
                        The process is exactly the same each time and the number of jars that need lids are specified/known before you start.</p>

                    <h3>DOM - Document Object Model</h3><br>
                    <p>The Document Object Model forms the underlying structure of every web page. It's essentially what’s displayed in the browser window and is able to be manipulated by programming languages, such as JavaScript.</p>
                    <p>You can think of the DOM like a JavaScript Object containing a lot (really a lot!) of objects and subobjects. You don’t really need to know all of them, but some of them are essential to extracting or changing content on a webpage.</p>
                    <p>To break it down further, in non-technical terms - imagine the DOM as an apple tree and the earth or soil as a basic HTML webpage. The tree would not grow apples and function as intended without being able to plant its roots deep into the soil. 
                        These roots interact with the ground below and gather the necessary nutrients, which then travel up its stems and nourishes the branches and fruit above.</p>
                    <p>The network of stems that are rooted beneath the ground is like the Object Model!</p>

                    <h3>Accessing data from arrays or objects</h3><br>
                    <p>Objects are used to represent “things” that are made up of or are defined by a set of characteristics. This could be anything ranging from houses, plants, people, books, food etc. All these things or “objects” have characteristics, such as their color, size, contents, amount, price etc. 
                        In coding terms these characteristics are referred to as “properties”.</p>
                    <p>Arrays on the other hand, are more of a list of items, which may or may not relate to each other directly. Think of Arrays like a long, but ordered grocery shopping list.</p>
                    <p>Arrays are accessed with a number (index) whereas Objects are accessed by specifying the name of a specific characteristic (property). </p>

                    <h3>JavaScript Functions</h3><br>
                    <p>JavaScript Functions help developers in writing efficient, clean code that’s easier to maintain.</p>
                    <p>I’m going to use another cooking-related example to explain this in non-technical terms. Imagine you love making curry with your own unique spice-blend for dinner. 
                        Instead of creating the spice mix every evening that you decide to have curry, you could save yourself the time and hassle by creating one big batch and then reusing that spice mix each time you cook. 
                        This analogy doesn’t exactly cover all facets of a JavaScript Function, so for the sake of this example, imagine this spice mix is a special magical blend that never runs out (as a JS Function can be used an infinite amount of times).</p>
                    <p>Functions are especially useful when you know or suspect that the code you’re working on will repeat itself and be used more than once (even if it's with a slight variation).</p>
