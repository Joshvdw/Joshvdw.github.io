                    <p>I’ve learned several new things about myself as a result of the core learning process throughout foundations. These include my tendencies to avoid contact with people I don’t know, for example by putting off the Listening and Looping exercises until later on in the day. This is perhaps due to my previous troubles with social anxiety. I’m hoping to develop this skill more during bootcamp. </p>
                    <p>I also learned more about myself and the things I truly value by writing the Identity, Values & Strengths blog post. Putting these values into words helped me to understand myself better.</p>
                    <p>The final thing I’m going to mention is the core exercise on neuroplasticity. I definitely learned a lot during this part of foundations, as I read up a lot about it during my research. Methods for increasing the neuroplasticity in my brain are handy to know during studying as they’ll help me retain the information more quickly, and more efficiently. Examples include: regular repetition, deploying a growth mindset, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and work-life balance.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Values, empathy and self awareness play a vital role in learning and programming. As I mentioned earlier, writing down my values helped me to understand myself better. I believe this is useful for the learning process as you know what’s important to you personally, and can use this to manage your time and study in a way that works for you. </p>
                    <p>Empathy and self awareness are important skills to develop in both the learning and work environment, as it allows you to work in teams / groups better. You’ll be able to understand where the person you are programming with is coming from and empathise with their viewpoint. </p>
                    <p>Self awareness allows you to be a “team player” and adapt more to changing work / study environments.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>What surprised me the most about learning core during the foundations part of the course, was the benefits I could see coming out of identifying my personal core values and writing the learning plan. It was a useful experience and great to reflect back on at times throughout the sprints and has given me some more direction going into bootcamp.</p>
                    <p>I found the Listening and Looping aspects of the core learning the most challenging. As I mentioned earlier, this could be because of my previous experiences with social anxiety. I’m getting better at it, but still a hesitation comes from within when these situations arise. I’ve noticed it's best to not overthink it and just do it with a burst of self-confidence (even if it's just imagined!).</p>
                    <p>My theory on why Dev Academy spends so much time on the core learning part of web development, is because of the importance of these skills in the real-life workplace environment. This may be stereotyping a little, but I believe in general that traditional “tech” oriented folks aren’t exactly known for their social skills. Even though they may prefer to put their headphones on and sit alone in the corner coding away, this is not really the reality of a well-functioning office. Being able to interact well with others, adapt to the work environment and bring a certain all-around confidence to the office are sought-after skills in industry.</p>
                    <p>Spending the time studying core does not feel like a waste of time. I found there was still enough time and emphasis being put on the coding as well.</p>
