            <h3>Long term goal / career pathway</h3><br>
            <p>I’m hoping to use the skills I learn during this course, particularly the Human Skills, to help me land my first job as a web developer in industry. I’m hoping these skills will help me thrive in the work environment and provide me with long-lasting opportunities to grow my career.</p>
            <p>Although I do not have a specific company in mind that I’d like to work for, I do know that I only want to take jobs in companies or businesses that I believe are making a positive impact on this world. I believe technology has the potential to greatly benefit people’s lives, as well as causing potential harm due to how new the technological age is and how fast-paced it is progressing.</p>
            <p>Developing features to “hook” or addict users on their platform, or developing tools that collect user’s private data without their consent would have negative impacts I do not want to be a part of. Providing good ethical tech that provides a service that benefits society is something I want to focus on.</p>
            <p>My long term goals haven’t changed much since Foundations, so what I wrote under that heading below is still relevant and something to take into consideration as well.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3><br>
            <p>When re-evaluating the strengths and limitations that I wrote during Foundations, I believe they apply just as much to the Bootcamp part of the course too. Perhaps the strength about being a good independent and self-motivated learner won’t apply as much because of the highly collaborative nature of Bootcamp (as opposed to a more solo learning experience during foundations).</p>
            <p>I believe being able to thrive under pressure will be one of my biggest strengths during Bootcamp, when the going gets really tough especially. I have experience with meeting tight deadlines, staying up all night to finish editing a project when I worked as a video editor. </p>
            <p>My biggest limitation may be my tendency to get distracted at times when interfacing with the internet. I plan to uninstall potentially distracting apps from my phone that will serve no use to me during Bootcamp (Reddit for example). Keeping my tabs on chrome minimal and in a productive state is another way to stay focused on the course content.</p>
            <p>One new strength that has come up is my past experience with Graphic Design and UX. I studied these subjects for two years previous to this course and I believe they’ll come in really handy when collaborating on projects during Bootcamp. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3><br>
            <p>I think my biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be staying 100% focused on the course for the entire 9 week duration. I have never attempted anything as immersive as 60 hours a week. This will definitely be a challenging and new experience for me.</p>
            <p>I also get really nervous when speaking publicly. I get a lot of fear building up inside me when a situation is approaching where I have to speak in front of an audience. This will be a great challenge for me, but something I’m keen to grow in and overcome. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3><br>
            <p>As I mentioned before, speaking publicly is not my strong suit. This is definitely a human skill I wish to develop in myself whilst I’m at Dev Academy.</p>
            <p>I would also like to get better at working with others in a group / collaborative-based environment. There are improvements I can make in the way I communicate and give / receive feedback. I want to be considered a good “team player” that takes initiative and is a valued member in the group. I believe that the Bootcamp at Dev Academy will be a great place to develop these skills.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3><br>
            <p>I expect the team at Bootcamp to help guide me and the other students through the course curriculum of Dev Academy. I do not expect them to teach us everything and I believe it’s up to us to take charge of our own learning somewhat. </p>
            <p>I do expect a member of the team to be available to discuss potential issues if they arise during the course.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3><br>
            <p>I have several expectations of myself for Bootcamp. I already wrote these down in my notes prior to writing this learning plan. </p>
            <ul class="learning-plan-list">
                <li>I will not start slacking during the course and arrive late to class. I will wake up on time everyday, do the appropriate things to get ready and leave the house when I’m supposed to</li>
                <li>I will acknowledge and take care of my health by taking regular breaks from the computer. I will walk to school to start my day off right and will do some form of exercise on the weekend too.</li>
                <li>I will minimise potential distractions by uninstalling unproductive apps on my phone and not having tabs open that are unrelated to the work I’m doing. I won’t commit to things outside the course that are unnecessary and maintain my focus on Bootcamp</li>
                <li>I will stay true to my learning plan and the skills I want to develop during this course</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="main-text-learning-plan">
      
            <h3>Long term goal/career pathway</h3><br>
            <p>My plan for my career pathway is to enter the industry as a developer in whichever way I can, getting my “foot in the door” and building that initial work experience up.</p>
            <p>This means taking any opportunity that presents itself, as long as it does not infringe with my core values.</p>
            <p>My long term plan is to eventually work as an independent freelancer. This aligns well with my personality / core values, and I love the idea of being able to work from home or anywhere else in the world with a laptop. Focusing on smaller businesses, as opposed to larger corporations has always appealed to me.</p>
            <p>I’ve also found myself really thriving as my own boss and having more input/control in the various aspects of a project. This may also be achieved through working in smaller dev teams, than very large international companies.</p>

                    <ul class="learning-plan-list">
                        <li>I’ve always been quite an independent and self-motivated learner. I know how to use the internet to my advantage and often research or practice the required learning skills further in my own time.</li>
                        <li>Thriving under pressure, such as when a difficult challenge presents itself, is definitely one of my strengths and I think this skill will benefit my learning capabilities during Bootcamp a lot, as it’ll be very challenging and demanding.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="flex-1">
                    <p>Limitations</p>
                    <ul class="learning-plan-list">
                        <li>Due to the immersive nature of the Dec Academy course, my free time will be limited and I need to make sure not to get distracted with my various other interests / hobbies that I have outside of course. I can sometimes lose focus, which may be a limitation to my learning.</li>
                        <li>Speaking publicly has always been a weakness of mine, which has led to me avoiding it in the past. This may be a learning limitation for me, as part of the reason I’m attending Dev Academy is to develop this skill.</li>

                    <br>
                    <p>I’ll manage myself to work productively and well with others by always putting my best foot forward. I’ll ensure to approach every project and challenge with the same commitment to effort and being a good “team player” during group projects.</p>
                    <p>When things start building up and getting to me, I’ll make sure to take a small break, a deep breath and deploy techniques to break down whatever problem I may be facing into smaller chunks, then approach them step by step.</p>
                    <p>I’m also planning to participate in the mindfulness and yoga practices that the course offers during bootcamp, as these have proven to help as well.</p>

                    <p>If I do end up getting overwhelmed, I’ll initially seek support from my girlfriend, friends & family.</p> 
                    <p>If I need help with something specific to the course, I’ll make sure to reach out to my facilitator or look to the other students at Dev Academy for support.</p>
                    <p>We’re all going through the same thing and in this thing together!</p>
