            <h3>Long term goal/ career pathway</h3><br>
            <p>My plan for my career pathway is to enter the industry as a developer in whichever way I can, getting my “foot in the door” and building that initial work experience up.</p>
            <p>This means taking any opportunity that presents itself, as long as it does not infringe with my core values.</p>
            <p>My long term plan is to eventually work as an independent freelancer. This aligns well with my personality / core values, and I love the idea of being able to work from home or anywhere else in the world with a laptop. Focusing on smaller businesses, as opposed to larger corporations has always appealed to me.</p>
            <p>I’ve also found myself really thriving as my own boss and having more input/control in the various aspects of a project. This may also be achieved through working in smaller dev teams, than very large international companies.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Strengths & Limitations in relation to learning</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Strengths</p>
            <ul class="learning-plan-list">
                <li>I’ve always been quite an independent and self-motivated learner. I know how to use the internet to my advantage and often research or practice the required learning skills further in my own time.</li>
                <li>Thriving under pressure, such as when a difficult challenge presents itself, is definitely one of my strengths and I think this skill will benefit my learning capabilities during Bootcamp a lot, as it’ll be very challenging and demanding.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Limitations</p>
            <ul class="learning-plan-list">
                <li>Due to the immersive nature of the Dec Academy course, my free time will be limited and I need to make sure not to get distracted with my various other interests / hobbies that I have outside of course. I can sometimes lose focus, which may be a limitation to my learning.</li>
                <li>Speaking publicly has always been a weakness of mine, which has led to me avoiding it in the past. This may be a learning limitation for me, as part of the reason I’m attending Dev Academy is to develop this skill.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Skills to develop in myself at Dev Academy</h3>
            <br>
            <ul class="learning-plan-list">
                <li>Develop teamwork, social & other soft-skills such as public speaking </li>
                <li>Be a valuable asset to the team, take initiative in group projects</li>
                <li>Think about others and seek to help them out</li>
                <li>Build a network, make connections with peers & get to know industry folks</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How I’ll manage my workload</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I’ll manage myself to work productively and well with others by always putting my best foot forward. I’ll ensure to approach every project and challenge with the same commitment to effort and being a good “team player” during group projects.</p>
            <p>When things start building up and getting to me, I’ll make sure to take a small break, a deep breath and deploy techniques to break down whatever problem I may be facing into smaller chunks, then approach them step by step.</p>
            <p>I’m also planning to participate in the mindfulness and yoga practices that the course offers during bootcamp, as these have proven to help as well.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>How and where I’ll seek help</h3><br>
            <p>If I do end up getting overwhelmed, I’ll initially seek support from my girlfriend, friends & family. If I need help with something specific to the course, I’ll make sure to reach out to my facilitator or look to the other students at Dev Academy for support, as we’re all going through the same thing and in this thing together!</p>
            <br>
            <h3>What I expect from the facilitation team</h3><br>
            <p>I expect the facilitator team to be reachable in some way when I need them and to have some valuable input on a potential solution if I’m having an issue.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Scheduling info or other commitments </h3><br>
            <p>I’m 100% committed to the course at Dev Academy and made sure to clear prior arrangements, so that I can maintain full focus during the course. Receiving Student Allowance enables me to study full-time without having to work at the same time.</p>
