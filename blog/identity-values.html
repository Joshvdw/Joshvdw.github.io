            <h3>My Values:</h3><br>
            <ul class="learning-plan-list">
                <li><em>Being Challenged</em>, spending my time daily doing something that engages my brain, I deeply enjoy being challenged in an intellectual or creative way</li>
                <li><em>Free Time</em>, maintaining a healthy work / life balance, having enough free time to explore my other passions and not getting burned out doing only one thing</li>
                <li><em>Independence</em>, being in charge of how I approach things in my own unique way & managing my time in a way that I know promotes personal productivity</li>
                <li><em>Logicalness</em>, I like things to make sense & am always on the lookout for a logical explanation, I prefer the “why” than to be kept in the dark</li>
                <li><em>Creative Expression</em>, I have always had a need to creatively express myself, I have been into creative writing, making music & film-making since I was a kid</li>
                <li><em>Structure</em>, I value being organised and having structure in my life, I like things to be planned out beforehand and routines help me stay focused</li>
                <li><em>Self-Identity</em>, I value staying true to myself, although some adjustments are normal, I do not believe in completely changing who I am in order to fit in</li>
                <li><em>Fairness</em>, I value things to be equal and do not believe in people receiving special treatment, unless there are good reasons for it</li>
                <li><em>Honesty</em>, I try to be “straight up” with people and treat others with honesty, and I deeply value that they treat me the same way back</li>
                <li><em>Ethicality</em>, I value not exacerbating issues that I personally deem unethical through my actions, this is especially true in regards to technology</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Evidence:</h3><br>
            <ul class="learning-plan-list">
                <li><em>Being Challenged</em> - I’ve done a lot of Barista work in the past, and the main reasons that I decided to leave the hospitality industry, is that it did not challenge me enough in creative or intellectual ways</li>
                <li><em>Independence</em> - At my previous study (Web & UX at Yoobee Colleges), when things switched to a home-learning environment due to Covid-19, I actually strived and learned more effectively as I was able to better plan my time to suit my own needs. </li>
                <li><em>Logicalness</em> - At my previous study, when things wouldn’t make entirely sense to me, I would research it further in my own time in order to fully understand the “why” and what the point of it is. For example, at first I did not understand what the point was to some of the extensive UX activities (such as interviewing, surveys, questionnaires etc), then after I researched it further, I learned about Donald Norman, his book (The Design of Everyday Things) and the work he’s done with Apple. After learning about that, it was much easier for me to do the work as it seemed more logical and I could clearly see the reason why it's done.</li>
                <li><em>Creative Expression</em> - I initially pursued a career in film-making and later in music producing, both are very creative disciplines and I followed these career paths as I had been expressing myself through these outlets for as long as I could remember. It was only in my late 20s that I realised I could continue these passions as hobbies, in my own time, and do something with a bit more job security as a career path.</li>
                <li><em>Honesty</em> - a few years back I was unhappy with how the Head Barista at a Cafe here in Wellington was treating me. Instead of remaining silent and frustrated, I decided to take action and voice my concern to the manager. He was happy I spoke up and he commended my honesty in this instance.</li>
                <li><em>Ethicality</em> - an example of me exercising this value, was when I had an internship interview last year for Summer of Tech, but decided not to take it as it did not align with my values on Ethical Tech. I will obviously not name the company, but they were centred around personal data collection, which is something I don’t entirely stand behind and I knew that I would find it difficult to put my full effort into work everyday if I don’t agree with the cause.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Cultural Identity</h3><br>
            <p>My culture is somewhat complex as I moved a lot as a kid, am 50/50 Dutch & British and spent exactly half my upbringing between the Netherlands and New Zealand. I’ve always had some difficulty pinpointing exactly which culture I most identify with, hence I’ve spent the last few years moving between Europe and NZ, trying to find out which culture feels most like “home”. Although I have not fully uncovered the answers to these questions (it’ll be a life-long journey), I felt a calling to move back to Wellington as I do find it easier to relate to Kiwis, more than any other culture.</p>
            <p>Some of my values that correlate to my cultural identity, are that being “straight up” and honest with one another is something very present in my Dutch Heritage / Culture. My parents are like this to the extreme and it has taken some of their Kiwi friends a while to get used to!</p>
            <p>Having the time to express myself creatively is something I developed through my upbringing here in rural New Zealand. In the Netherlands, a high-school student is much more caught up in academic work as the workload is much larger, and I greatly contribute being able to explore my creative passions to having enough after-school time to work on them. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Strengths</h3><br>
            <p><b>Independence</b> - working from home, self-directed learning like I’m currently doing definitely works well for me and is a strength to my learning and career development.</p>
            <p><b>Structure</b> - there seems to be quite a lot of structure around the curriculum and learning environment of Dev Academy and this works well for my development, as I have a good overview of what’s happening / coming up and can create a productive routine around it.</p>
            <p><b>Being Challenged</b> - from what I’ve gathered, the Bootcamp part of Dev Academy will be one of the most challenging things I’ve ever done, and to be honest, I’m looking forward to the challenge and think I’ll strive in such a learning environment.</p>
            <p><b>Ethicality</b> - Dev Academy seems to have similar values when it comes to the relationship of ethics and technology, and I think this alignment will greatly benefit my learning and career development </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Limitations</h3><br>
            <p><b>Free Time</b> - with the fully immersive experience that Dev Academy offers, I know that my free time will be limited during this time, which is something I expected and am prepared for.</p>
            <p><b>Creative Expression</b> - although I’m sure there will be moments to creatively express myself through coding and decision making, my main objective with this course is to develop my human-skills and technical knowledge.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Group Project Example</h3><br>
            <p>When working on a group project during my time at Yoobee Colleges, there was some tension between two of the group members. They weren’t completely on the same page and one of them kept going off and doing their own thing. </p>
            <p>At the time I was trying to mediate the situation and listen to both perspectives, before helping to resolve the issue. I think I could improve next time by acting faster and taking more initiative to come up with solutions.</p>
