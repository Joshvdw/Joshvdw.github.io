            <h3>Long term goal/ career pathway</h3><br><br>
            <p>To better understand neuroplasticity, let’s break down the word that defines it.</p>
            <p><strong>Neural:</strong> relating to the nervous system</p>
            <p><strong>Plasticity:</strong> the capacity to adapt or change</p>
            <p>Together these words describe the brain’s ability to change itself and learn new behaviours.</p><br>
            <p>Some of the core principles of neuroplasticity include:</p>
            <p><strong>Use it or lose it</strong> - Failure to drive specific brain functions can lead to loss of abilities</p>
            <p><strong>Use it & improve it</strong> - Training that drives a specific brain function can lead to improving abilities</p>
            <p><strong>Specificity</strong> - The nature of the training experience dictates the nature of the change in the brain</p>
            <p><strong>Repetition matters</strong> - Change (plasticity) requires sufficient repetition</p>
            <p><strong>Intensity matters</strong> - Change (plasticity) requires intensive training</p>
            <p><strong>Time matters</strong> - Different forms of change in the brain happen at different times during training</p><br>
            <p>Understanding these principles benefit people because it shatters common misconceptions and myths that everyone is born with an inherited IQ level that pretty much stays the same throughout their lifetime. 
                This has been proven untrue. Understanding neuroplasticity encourages people to tackle more challenging goals and believe in their ability to learn new things. </p>
            <p>Better understanding neuroplasticity and the brain in general, should help people persist through the most difficult stages of studying something new, such as coding for example!</p>
            <p>In order to put neuroplasticity into practice, I’m going to make sure I do something coding related every day for the duration of this course (with perhaps the odd day off in the weekend to take a break, as that’s important too). I’m going to keep challenging myself to learn new things, which will create new pathways in my brain, and not be put off by the initial difficulty that may summon feelings of overwhelming resistance. Neuroplasticity proves it can be done!</p><br>
            <p>Neuroplasticity can be increased by:</p>
            <p><strong>A healthy lifestyle</strong> - Sleep, diet and sufficient exercise has been proven to increase your brain’s neuroplasticity ability</p>
            <p><strong>Work-life Balance</strong> - taking frequent breaks and allowing your mind to completely switch off at the end of the day, allows for improved muscle re-building in the brain </p>
            <p><strong>Repetition</strong> - Recalling your knowledge and problem-solving skills repeatedly will strengthen those neural pathways</p>
            <p>Here is an article that I found particularly interesting:</p>
            <br>
            <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/07/dalai-lama-neuroscience-compassion/397706/"><p>https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/07/dalai-lama-neuroscience-compassion/397706/</p></a>
            <p>It's about brain research conducted on Tibetan Buddhist monks with the help of the Dalai Lama. It proves that a life devoted to compassion and meditation can alter the brain significantly.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Growth Mindset</h3><br>
            <p>The growth mindset means believing that your skills / abilities can be developed and “grown” through dedications, hard-work and persistence. Understanding these concepts and 	deploying this outlook on life is beneficial as it creates a love for learning and a resilience that’s essential for achieving higher goals.</p>
            <p>I’m familiar with the growth mindset and the brain’s malleable ability as I’ve read several self-help / improvement books that teach these concepts. However, I did learn something new in the article I linked about the brain research done on monks. Found it really interesting that there’s scientific brain evidence to back up these very ancient practices. </p>
            <p>I also hadn’t heard of Carol Dweck before and found her research particularly engaging.</p>
            <p>I will integrate the growth mindset into my learning journey by not giving up when the going gets tough, especially during the intensive bootcamp part of the course. Deploying a growth mindset will help me to overcome potential learning roadblocks that may arise during these challenging times.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I found this article about Carol Dweck’s research really interesting as it displayed the graphs and charts that came out of the experiments done during their studies.</p>

            <h3>Learning Plan</h3><br>
            <p>When I wrote my learning plan I believe it was already influenced by a growth mindset, as I was aware of it and actively practicing it before going into this course. I’ve pursued multiple career paths already and have always had a lot of faith in my own ability to learn and adapt to new challenges.</p>
            <p>Some aspects of my learning plan could definitely be improved by adding some of the findings I’ve made during today’s research. It could take some more of the principles of Neuroplasticity into consideration, such as promoting a healthy lifestyle by eating well and sleeping / exercising enough. This will greatly benefit my learning and my brain’s ability to learn.</p>
