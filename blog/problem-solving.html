            <p>Due to the technical and often complex nature of programming, problems frequently arise when web developing. Improving problem solving skills and creating meta-strategies to better overcome these issues is thus paramount to becoming a more well-rounded web developer.</p>
            <p>Problem solving techniques can be deployed in several ways. I'm going to describe a time when I got blocked on a relatively simple problem and solved it in an elegant way.</p>
            <p>There was a time during the Sprint 4 Kata exercises that I got stuck on an exercise called <strong>Fizzbuzz</strong>. In this challenge I had to create a function that took a number and returned “fizz” if the number is divisible by 3, “buzz” if divisible by 5, “fizzbuzz” if its divisible by both 3 and 5 and return the input number if its not divisible by either. </p>
            <p>I was certain I had figured it out with a simple if statement and several comparison operators. However, I kept getting an error message when I’d run the test. </p>
            <p>In order to solve the problem, I read the code I had so far out loud to myself in very simple terms. This is a variation of the <strong>rubber duck technique</strong>. It helps because you’re reading the problem out loud, step by step, and it can make you see it from a different perspective. </p>
            <p>After deploying this problem solving technique, I was able to solve it more easily. I figured out that all I needed to do was swap the order of my if statement around. I initially had the “fizzbuzz” statement at the bottom, but I needed it at the top instead.</p>
            <p>I felt frustrated initially when working on this problem, as I knew the majority of my code was right. I learned something about the specificity of an if statement in this exercise, as well as that the rubber ducky technique definitely works in practice!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I feel moderately confident in my <strong>pseudocoding</strong> abilities. It seems easy enough in theory, but sometimes I do find it difficult to know exactly what I should be writing down. If I’m not very familiar with the code that needs to be used, I sometimes find it easier to start with googling.</p>
            <p>Just <em>“trying something”</em> is a technique I use frequently and feel very confident in. I’m experienced and have always been quite good at solving through trial-and-error.</p>
            <p>The <strong>rubber ducky method</strong> is somewhat new to me (i’ve never actually read my problem out to an inanimate object like a rubber duck before!), but I can definitely see how it's useful. I am familiar with reading a problem out loud to myself and using that as a problem solving technique.</p>
            <p>I am fairly confident with reading <strong>error messages</strong>, but when they are very long with all kinds of complex and wordy errors, I do get a bit overwhelmed. Usually this is not the case though and I can work out quite easily what the error message is telling me. If not, I can easily find the answer online by copy and pasting it into Google. </p>
            <p><strong>Console.logging</strong> as a problem solving technique is one of my most go-to method’s. I learned this from a previous tutor of mine, who had many many years experience. Console.logging your variables, statements etc. at each step of the programming process can help quickly find which line of code is causing issues, especially with JavaScript.</p>
            <p><strong>Googling</strong> is another technique that I’m very familiar with. I’ve been doing it for many years and not only for programming related issues, but in other disciplines and hobbies too. I’m well versed in the different wording techniques that are required to get the right results back from Google.</p>
            <p>Asking peers for help is probably not my strongest skill and something I don’t feel very confident in. I often prefer to work the problem out myself, but know that it's sometimes better just to ask a peer, as it saves on time and is more efficient. Getting better at this is actually one of the reasons I’m attending Dev Academy!</p>
            <p>Asking coaches or tutors for help is something I’m definitely more familiar with and good at. I like to draw on mentors who have more experience and knowledge than me. I usually approach them first, before asking peers, but this is something I’m willing to change as I could see it being perhaps better the other way around.</p>
            <p>Improving my learning process and problem technique through <strong>reflection</strong> is something I’m familiar with and pretty good at, but more internally than externally. With this I mean that I frequently reflect on things in my head, but haven’t often written it down into words. Having done this during the foundation’s part of the course has been very beneficial though, I can see why its part of the curriculum!</p>
