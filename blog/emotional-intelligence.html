                    <h3>What is emotional intelligence? </h3><br>
                    <p>Emotional Intelligence relates to being able to understand and manage your own emotions more effectively, and in a more positive way. It can relieve tension when stressed and help you empathize with others. It's also very useful for overcoming difficult challenges and defusing conflict.</p>
                    <p>Emotional Intelligence can help build stronger relationships with others and success in study or work. Creating deeper connections with your feelings, will increase the chances of achieving your goals (career or otherwise), as you tend to turn intention into action and make more informed life decisions.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>How is it different from IQ? </h3><br>
                    <p>Whereas Emotional Intelligence (or EQ) focuses more on your feelings and emotions, Intellectual Intelligence (or IQ) focuses more on your cognitive abilities, such as logical thinking, problem solving, strategizing, adaptability, understanding abstract ideas etc.</p>
                    <p>Emotional Intelligence is different as it refers more to your ability to identify emotions, empathize with others,  adapt behaviour, control impulses, delay gratification, communicate effectively and resolve conflicts. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Why is it important?</h3><br>
                    <p>Itâ€™s common knowledge that higher IQ leads to better academic or job performance. However, recent studies have shown that a higher EQ may have just as much impact, if not more, on achieving and maintaining a successful career.</p>
                    <p>Emotional Intelligence helps you to deal with stress and since Dev Academy is a highly intensive course, developing this skill will be of great benefit.</p>
